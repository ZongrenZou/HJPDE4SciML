# Leveraging multi-time HJ PDEs for SciML
This repository contains source code for the paper (to be published in SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing (SISC)): [Leveraging Multi-time Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs for Certain Scientific Machine Learning Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12928)

# Requirements
For example 3, TensorFlow 2.7.0 is used. All examples are run on CPUs.

# Explore more
The following will be updated in a follow-up paper:
- Efficient update in the Runge-Kutta scheme
- Just-in-time compilation
- GPU-accelerated implementation
